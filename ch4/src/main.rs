/*
Here’s a small programming problem: write a function that takes a 
    string of words separated by spaces and returns the first 
    word it finds in that string. If the function doesn’t find 
    a space in the string, the whole string must be one word, 
    so the entire string should be returned.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
